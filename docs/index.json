Use the JFrog CLI in your build process. Use Cloud Build, triggers for your CI/CD solution. Use Local, Remote and Virtual Repositories in Artifactory. Publish artifact Build Info. Scan your artifacts and builds for security vulnerabilities. Deploy your application in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using Cloud Deploy.  The examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.\n "

License violations are available in the JFrog Platform Pro and Enterprise tiers.   Click on any violation to see the details and impact in the Issue Details tab.   Scroll down to the References section to access links to documentation that can help you remediate the issue. In many cases, you just need to update the component and Xray will indicate this.   Xray supports all major package types, understands how to unpack them, and uses recursive scanning to see into all of the underlying layers and dependencies of components, even those packaged in Docker images, and zip files. The comprehensive vulnerability intelligence databases are constantly updated giving the most up-to-date understanding of the security and compliance of your binaries.\n Close the Issue Details tab. View the Docker configuration for the image in the Docker Layers tab. On the Builds tab, click on npm_build in the list.  Then click on your most recent build.

	"content": "In this workshop, we used Google Cloud Build to build JFrog CLI, then used the Cloud Build and JFrog Platform to build an application, manage the artifacts, scan the artifacts for security vulnerabilities and license compliance, and publish the artifacts of your application to a staging repository. Then we used Coud Deploy to deploy your application to GKE so that end-users can access it. The JFrog Platform and Google Cloud demonstrate how you can build a DevSecOps cloud platform to delivery your software to your end-users securily. This modernizes your software delivery life cycle enabling your organization to deliver quality software continuously and maintain a Secure Software Chain by leveraging advanced cloud services and infrastructure.\n"

	"content": "Any security issue identified by a security scanning may be reviewed by a small security team that may lack the technical knowledge. This challenge can be reduced by shifting left to the developer and operations teams, making them also responsible for security and compliance. This moves security earlier in the software delivery process. Source code, dependency and artifact security scanning are some examples of moving security into the development process. Implementing the identification of security issues earlier in the CI/CD pipeline, as well as automating security and compliance policies in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), rather than using manual processes, is crucial. Moreover, organizations that leave the Sec out of DevOps, may face security and compliance issues that are closer to their release, resulting in additional costs for remediating such issues.\nAs you move your SDLC to the cloud, your DevSecOps strategy must also adapt to the cloud. As discussed previously, binary repository managers that scale globally across cloud data centers require DevSecOps tools that will likewise scale and adjust. An enterprise scale software delivery system with multiple development teams, end users and devices mean more entry points for potential security and compliance issues. Therefore, it is critical that your SLDC is well-integrated with your DevSecOps system.\n"
